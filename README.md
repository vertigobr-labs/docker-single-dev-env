# single-dev-env
Example used to try a single container sample of Docker Dev Environments

## Run the application
You can simply use `make run` command or do it yourself with `go run main.go`

Those commands will start a http server listening on port `8080` 
and if your request `http://localhost:8080` you'll see the following output: 
```shell
‚ùØ curl http://localhost:8080

Hello from Docker!

## Hot reloading
You can simply use `make dev` command to run the application with hot reloading changes.

fresh
```
